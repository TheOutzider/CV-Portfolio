- Primary color: Bright green (#32CD32) for the active text and highlights.
- Background color: Very dark desaturated green (#1A1A1A) to mimic a console screen.
- Accent color: Slightly lighter green (#98FF98) for interactive elements or emphasized text.
- Headline and body font: 'Source Code Pro' monospaced font for a terminal-like appearance.
- Use simple line icons, styled in the same bright green color, for visual cues or interactive elements.
- Structure the CV information in a blocky, terminal-style layout, mimicking the look of command-line interfaces.
- Implement animations like text scrolling, cursor blinking, and lines drawing themselves to simulate an active console session.
